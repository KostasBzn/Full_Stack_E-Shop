# 🚴‍♂️ **Full Stack Bike E-shop**

A full-stack e-commerce application built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. This project showcases user authentication, product management, and shopping functionalities.

## 🌟 **Features**
- **User Authentication**: 
  - Register and login with email authentication and error handling.
  - Email verification and password recovery using **ElasticEmail**.
- **Administrator Panel**: 
  - Add, edit, delete, and categorize products.
